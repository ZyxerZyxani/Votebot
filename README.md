# Votebot
My voting bot.\n
Read all the comments (everything after a '#' is a comment) in the source code for dokumentation. If it looks like commented code then skip it, but everything that doesn't look like code and is a comment is probably dokumentation.
At the moment all documentation is in the source as comments.
For all that got here from someone claiming it is anonymous voting and linked here for info, the source code can be changed by anyone and it requires very simple and basic coding knowledge in order to change this so the one running it gets a list on who voted for what, so either compare this code with that other person and make sure he never change it, or do not trust that you will guaranteed be anonymous.
